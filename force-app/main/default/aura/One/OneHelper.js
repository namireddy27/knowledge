Description:

As a Field MAP Candidate,

I want my hiring stage to update to "Application Review" when the JOA closes,

So that I know my application is under review

-----

Given I am a Field MAP Candidate,

and I have applied to a JOA,

then,



1) The portal view of my hiring stage updates from "Application Received" to "Application Review" when the JOA close date is reached.



Developer Notes:
-----------------


When  related JOA closes the Hiring Status changes to" Application Review" once the JOA related to the application is closed for Application record type of "Field Map"


* Flow needs to be created

* Verify that the Application Hiring Stage is updated and the change is reflected in the Internal/external set paths
